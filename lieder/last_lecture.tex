\refrain{
Last lecture I gave you a proof\\
but the very next day you showed me my fail\\
This time to save me from tears,\\
I’ll present you something special.}

\strophe{(repeat)}

\strophe{
My sweet proof is still wrong.\\
The next approach will surely come along\\
Tell me reader, do you understand it?\\
Well, neither do I, I don't comprehend it.}

\strophe{
The paper I wrapped it up and sent it\\
With a note saying ``q.e.d.'', I meant it!\\
Now I know what a fool I've been\\
But reading it now, I know I will fail again.}

\refrain{
Last lecture I gave you a proof\\
but the very next day you showed me my fail\\
This time to save me from tears,\\
I’ll present you something special.}

\strophe{(repeat)}

\strophe{
Oooohhhh\\
Oh oh, reader}

\strophe{
The idea was great, and the error so small\\
And maybe the reader will not find it at all.\\
Let's see if it will stay unrecognized\\
And I will pass the course with it.}
